#Using Grunt to automate a MEAN stack application.

This is a repo for a starter appliation for a Single Page MEAN Stack application using grunt.

A simple MEAN app can use Grunt. Our app will consist of:

- A simple view
- An Angular controller, service, and main Angular module
- Use Grunt to process CSS (LESS and minify)
- Use Grunt to process JS (jshint and minify)
- Use Grunt to watch for file changes and process them
- Use Grunt to start the Node server

#Installation

1. Download the repository
2. Install grunt: `npm install -g grunt-cli`
3. Install npm modules: `npm install` (packages in the newly automatically created node_modules folder)
4. Start up the server: `grunt`
5. View in browser at http://localhost:8080


Use this starter kit to build any MEAN stack application you like.
